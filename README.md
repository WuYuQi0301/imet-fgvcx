# FGVCx iMetCollection 2019 Challenge @ [FGVC6](https://sites.google.com/view/fgvc6/home), [CVPR 2019](http://cvpr2019.thecvf.com/)
The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, also known as the Met, has a diverse collection of over 1.5M objects of which over 300K have been digitized with imagery. The online cataloguing information is generated by Subject Matter Experts (SME) and includes a wide range of data. These include, but are not limited to: multiple object classifications, artist, title, period, date, medium, culture, size, provenance, geographic location, and other related museum objects within the Met’s collection. While the SME-generated annotations describe the object from an art history perspective, they can also be indirect in describing finer-grained attributes from the museum-goer’s understanding. Adding fine-grained attributes to aid in the visual understanding of the museum objects will enable the ability to search for visually related objects.   

## iMet: The Met’s digitized collection for FGVCx
We present The Met’s digitized and annotated collection as a multi-attribute FGVCx challenge for CVPR 2018.  
### Images
As shown in the previous example, multiple modalities can be expected and are camera sources are unknown. Each artifact in the dataset has one or more in-focus photographs. The photographs are often centered for objects, and in the case where the museum artifact is an entire room, the images are scenic in nature.
### Annotations
Each object is seen by a single worker without a verification step.  Workers are advised to add multiple labels from an ontology provided by The Met, and additionally are allowed to add free-form text when they see fit.  The crowd are able to view the museum’s online collection pages and are advised to avoid annotating labels already present. Specifically, the crowd is advised to annotate labels related to what they “see” or what they infer as the object’s “utility.” We consider these annotations noisy.

### Data sets
Each sample may contains at least one attribute label from a label set of 1138 attributes.
#### Training set
109274 Samples
#### Validation set
7443 Samples
#### Test set
38814 Samples

This is an FGVCx competition as part of the [FGVC^6 workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/fgvc6/home) at [CVPR 2019](http://cvpr2019.thecvf.com/).
